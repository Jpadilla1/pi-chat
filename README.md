## Intro

This project was done in a Data Communications class and it demonstrates the application layer of the TCP/IP Protocol Architecture.

## Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi is not needed but I recommend it because it's cool :)
- You will to create a small sqlite database with the sql script found under server/sql.
- Note: the sqlite library in the lib folder only works on ARM based CPU's, it may or may not work on your machine.
- You must at least have Java 8 installed to compile this project from source.
